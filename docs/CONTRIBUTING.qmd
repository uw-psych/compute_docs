## Contributing new content or changes

You can contribute content or changes to the guide by [forking]({{ meta website.repo-url }}/fork) this repository and submitting a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests). 

### Directions

To contribute to this guide, you should be familiar with collaborating on [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests), using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), and writing documents in Markdown (specifically [Quarto Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html)).

1. [Fork]({{ meta website.repo-url }}/fork) this repository.
2. [Clone](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) your fork locally.
3. Create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches) for your changes.
4. If you want to preview or build the site locally:
   1. Install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/getting-started/installation.html) (use version 1.4 or higher, or a 1.4 [pre-release](https://quarto.org/docs/download) version).
   2. Install [`R`](https://www.r-project.org/) (v4.1 or higher) and install the `rmarkdown` package with `install.packages("rmarkdown")`.
5. Make your changes (generally to `.qmd` files).
6. Add yourself to the list of authors in the YAML front matter of this page.
7. If adding a new page: 
   1. [Add a link to the page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html) in the [`_quarto.yml`]({{ meta repo-url }}/blob/main/_quarto.yml) `sidebar` section.
   2. If the page is part of a folder that contains an `index.qmd` file that has a `listing` section and the `contents` section within it does not include all the pages using a wildcard (e.g., `- "*.qmd"`), add the page to the `contents` section under the `listing` section.
   3. If the page should be listed on the [Welcome](/index.qmd) page, add a link to the page in the `index.qmd` file at the root of the repository.
   4. Ensure that the page has a `description` in the YAML front matter.
   5. Ensure that the page has a `title` in the YAML front matter OR that the page has a `#` heading at the top of the page.
8. If possible, preview your changes locally using [`quarto preview`](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/#website-preview).
9.  Open a pull request.

Once the pull request is opened, a project maintainer will review your changes and may request changes or ask questions. Once the changes are approved, a project maintainer will merge your changes into the main repository.

### Repository structure

The repository is structured as a [Quarto website project](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/).

The main files and folders are:

- `_quarto.yml`: [Quarto configuration file](https://quarto.org/docs/configuration/quarto-yml.html) for the website
- `index.qmd`: [Quarto Markdown](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/markdown-basics.html) file for the home page
- `docs/`: contains the page content
- `_examples/`: contains example code
- `_static`: contains static files that will be available to published web pages (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript)
- `_extensions/`: contains installed [Quarto extensions](https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/)
