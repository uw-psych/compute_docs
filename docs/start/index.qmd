# Getting started

(@) Get access to Hyak:
   - Active UW students can join UW Reserach Computing Club (RCC) to gain access to STF-funded nodes.
   - PIs or labs should purchase dedicated storage and compute resources.
(@) [Login to a cluster via SSH](./connect-ssh.qmd): 
  ``` bash
  ssh your-uw-netid@klone.hyak.uw.edu
  ```
(@) Navigate and understand its [compute infrastructure](../compute/index.qmd):  
    - Request compute jobs with [Slurm](../compute/slurm.qmd)
    - Access certain programs with [Lmod software modules](../compute/lmod.qmd)
    - Build and run software containers with [Apptainer](../compute/apptainer.qmd)
    - Create and access a virtual desktop with [hyakvnc](../start/hyakvnc.qmd)
