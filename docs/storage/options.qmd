::: callout-tip
Google Cloud also offers block storage, file storage, and archival storage services. See [here](https://cloud.google.com/products/storage) for more information.
:::

### Open Science Framework

[Open Science Framework](https://osf.io/) (OSF) is a web-based platform for managing research projects. OSF can be used to store research data and their metadata. It is best suited for collaborating with other researchers and sharing research data for papers.  [Storage addons](https://help.osf.io/article/395-storage-add-ons) are available to connect [Amazon S3](#amazon-web-services), [Dropbox](#dropbox), [GitHub](#github), [OneDrive](#uw-onedrive-for-business), and [GitHub](#github) to OSF.

### Dropbox

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is a subscription-based cloud file sync service. The University of Washington does not support Dropbox. Dropbox is not suited for storing sensitive data. However, Dropbox can be useful for storing non-sensitive data that is actively being worked on, and it provides convenient versioning and recovery options. Dropbox can be accessed on {{< term Klone >}} via {{< term rclone >}}.

### GitHub

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Files up to 100 MiB each can be stored in a GitHub repository. The total size of a repository [should be](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-large-files-on-github#repository-size-limits) under 5 GiB.

GitHub repositories can be made publicly available or can be made private. Private repositories are only accessible to collaborators who have been granted access to the repository. Private repositories are only available to collaborators who have GitHub accounts. GitHub repositories can be accessed from the GitHub website or the [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) application.

#### GitHub Releases

[GitHub Releases](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) can be used to store files up to 2 GiB in size each.

#### GitHub Packages

[GitHub Packages](https://docs.github.com/en/packages) can be used to create {{< term container "image|container images" >}} that can be uploaded to the [GitHub Container Registry](https://ghcr.io.). For public repositories, there are no charges nor storage limits. For private repositories, storage limits and charges [apply](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-packages/about-billing-for-github-packages). A GitHub account is required to access GitHub Packages.

Although GitHub Packages is not designed to store research data, it can be used to store research data in the form of a {{< term container image >}} containing an archive of research data (similar to a ZIP file). The data cannot be viewed or modified while stored in GitHub Packages, but can be downloaded and extracted from the {{< term container image >}}. Any changes to the data require creating a new image and uploading it to GitHub Packages.

Public packages can be accessed by anyone and should not be used for sensitive data. However, it may be possible to encrypt data before storing it in the image or to deploy an [encrypted container](https://apptainer.org/docs/user/main/encryption.html).

#### Large File Storage

GitHub has a [Large File Storage](https://git-lfs.github.com/) (LFS) extension that can be used to store large files in a GitHub repository.

According to [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/about-git-large-file-storage#about-git-large-file-storage), the file size limits for GitHub repositories are:

| Plan                    | Maximum file size
|-------------------------|------------------
GitHub Free	              | 2 GiB
GitHub Pro	              | 2 GiB
GitHub Team               | 4 GiB
GitHub Enterprise Cloud	  | 5 GiB
