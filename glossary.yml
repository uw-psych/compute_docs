Lmod: |
  An environment module system that is used to load additional software on Klone compute nodes.

Klone: |
  The latest generation of the Hyak supercomputer. See [here](./start) for how to use it.

compute node: |
  A node on the Klone cluster that is used for running jobs. See [here](./compute) for more information.

login node: |
  A node on the Klone cluster that is used for logging in and submitting jobs. See [here](./compute) for more information.

environment variable: |
  A variable that is used to store information about the environment that a job is running in. See [here](./compute/environment.qmd) for more information.

job: |
  A task that is submitted to the cluster to be run on a compute node. See [here](./compute) for more information.

job script: |
  A script that is submitted to the cluster to be run on a compute node. See [here](./compute) for more information.

job array: |
  A set of jobs that are submitted to the cluster to be run on compute nodes. See [here](./compute) for more information.

SLURM: |
  A job scheduler that is used to manage jobs on the Klone cluster. See [here](./compute) for more information.

SLURM job ID: |
  A unique identifier for a job that is submitted to the cluster. See [here](./compute) for more information.

Apptainer: |
  Smallest Effect Size of Interest: the smallest effect that is theoretically or practically meaningful

Singularity: |
  The former name of Apptainer, a software container platform that is used to run software on the Klone cluster. See [here](./compute/apptainer.qmd) for more information.

container image: |
  A file that contains a fully encapsulated software environment that can be run on the Klone cluster. See [here](./compute/apptainer.qmd) for more information.

Apptainer recipe: |
  A file that contains instructions for building a container image. See [here](./compute/apptainer.qmd) for more information.

Docker: |
  A popular software container platform that is not available on Klone; however, [Apptainer](./compute/apptainer.qmd) can be used to run Docker images on Klone.

GPU: |
  A graphics processing unit that is used for running compute-intensive tasks on the Klone cluster.

CUDA: |
  A parallel computing platform and programming model that is used for running compute-intensive tasks on the Klone cluster.
