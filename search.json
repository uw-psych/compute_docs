It also features free, unlimited survey functionality, a sophisticated export module with support for all the popular statistical programs, and supports HIPAA compliance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is a cloud computing platform that provides a number of different storage services, including Amazon S3, Amazon EBS, Amazon EFS, and Amazon Glacier. Amazon S3 is comparable to Azure Blobs. Amazon EBS is comparable to Azure Files. Amazon EFS is comparable to Azure Files. Amazon Glacier is comparable to Azure Archive Storage.\n\n\n\n\nData Egress Waiver, which effectively eliminates the standard charges for moving data out of the AWS Service.\nHIPAA Eligible Account, requires special request and approval, and is subject to important operational considerations to meet compliance requirements of HIPAA, the UW BAA, and UW Medicine Compliance Policies.\nAccessible on Klone via rclone\n\n\n\n\n\nThe approximate cost of storing 1 TiB of data per month is: - ~$25 for “hot” data accessed frequently (S3 Standard) - ~$5/month for “cold” data accessed infrequently (S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval)\nThe Data Egress Waiver eliminates the standard charges for moving data out of the AWS Service.\nUW IT has a subscription service for AWS that provides a discount of 5% and a waiver for data egress charges. The subscription is covered by UW’s HIPPAA BAA and other enterprise contracts. A UW Workday worktag is required to use the service. For more information, see the UW IT AWS page.\nFor detailed pricing information, see the AWS pricing calculator.\n\n\n\n\nUW faculty; UW staff; UW researchers; UW clinicians; UW academic units; UW administrative units; UW affiliated organizations; UW Medical Center; Harborview Medical Center; Any group with an approved UW blanket PO. NOTE: UW students are not eligible for this service, except when working within the scope of UW employment, e.g., as an RA, TA or GSA. Known Prerequisites: This service requires a valid UW budget number.\n\n\n\n\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud platform includes a number of storage options, including Azure Blobs and Azure Files.\nAzure Blobs is comparable to Amazon AWS S3. It is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data but is not designed to be used as a file system.\n\n\n\nCovered by UW’s HIPAA BAA and other enterprise contracts\nAccessible on Klone via rclone\n\n\n\n\nThe approximate cost of storing 1 TiB of data per month is: - ~$25 for “hot” data accessed frequently (Azure Blobs Hot Tier) - ~$5/month for “cold” data accessed infrequently (Azure Blobs Cold Tier)\nUW IT has a subscription service for Azure that provides a discount of roughly 10% on Azure usage charges and allows charges to be paid with a UW Workday worktag. A UW Workday worktag is required to use the service. For more information, see the UW IT Azure Subscription Service.\nFor detailed pricing information, see the Azure pricing calculator.\n\n\n\n\nUW faculty; UW staff; UW researchers; UW clinicians; UW academic units; UW administrative units; UW affiliated organizations; UW Medical Center; Harborview Medical Center; Any group with an approved UW blanket PO. NOTE: UW students are not eligible for this service, except when working within the scope of UW employment, e.g., as an RA, TA or GSA. Known Prerequisites: This service requires a valid UW budget number.\n\nUW-IT’s Azure Subscription service allows UW units that wish to create and manage their own Azure subscription to receive a discount (~10%) on Azure usage charges and to pay those with a UW Workday worktag.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud Storage is a cloud object storage service that is part of the Google Cloud Platform. It resembles the offerings by AWS and Azure. It is distinct from UW Google Drive and Google Drive. Google Cloud Storage can be accessed on Klone via rclone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud also offers block storage, file storage, and archival storage services. See here for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Science Framework (OSF) is a web-based platform for managing research projects. OSF can be used to store research data and their metadata. It is best suited for collaborating with other researchers and sharing research data for papers. Storage addons are available to connect Amazon S3, Dropbox, GitHub, OneDrive, and GitHub to OSF.\n\n\n\nDropbox is a subscription-based cloud file sync service. The University of Washington does not support Dropbox. Dropbox is not suited for storing sensitive data. However, Dropbox can be useful for storing non-sensitive data that is actively being worked on, and it provides convenient versioning and recovery options. Dropbox can be accessed on Klone via rclone.\n\n\n\nGitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Files up to 100 MiB each can be stored in a GitHub repository. The total size of a repository should be under 5 GiB.\nGitHub repositories can be made publicly available or can be made private. Private repositories are only accessible to collaborators who have been granted access to the repository. Private repositories are only available to collaborators who have GitHub accounts. GitHub repositories can be accessed from the GitHub website or the GitHub Desktop application.\n\n\nGitHub Releases can be used to store files up to 2 GiB in size each.\n\n\n\nGitHub Packages can be used to create container that can be uploaded to the GitHub Container Registry. For public repositories, there are no charges nor storage limits. For private repositories, storage limits and charges apply. A GitHub account is required to access GitHub Packages.\nAlthough GitHub Packages is not designed to store research data, it can be used to store research data in the form of a container containing an archive of research data (similar to a ZIP file). The data cannot be viewed or modified while stored in GitHub Packages, but can be downloaded and extracted from the container. Any changes to the data require creating a new image and uploading it to GitHub Packages.\nPublic packages can be accessed by anyone and should not be used for sensitive data. However, it may be possible to encrypt data before storing it in the image or to deploy an encrypted container.\n\n\n\nGitHub has a Large File Storage (LFS) extension that can be used to store large files in a GitHub repository.\nAccording to GitHub’s documentation, the file size limits for GitHub repositories are:\n\n\n\nPlan\nMaximum file size\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Free\n2 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Pro\n2 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Team\n4 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud\n5 GiB",

    "text": "Google Cloud Storage is a cloud object storage service that is part of the Google Cloud Platform. It resembles the offerings by AWS and Azure. It is distinct from UW Google Drive and Google Drive. Google Cloud Storage can be accessed on Klone via rclone.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nGoogle Cloud also offers block storage, file storage, and archival storage services. See here for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nOpen Science Framework (OSF) is a web-based platform for managing research projects. OSF can be used to store research data and their metadata. It is best suited for collaborating with other researchers and sharing research data for papers. Storage addons are available to connect Amazon S3, Dropbox, GitHub, OneDrive, and GitHub to OSF.\n\n\n\nDropbox is a subscription-based cloud file sync service. The University of Washington does not support Dropbox. Dropbox is not suited for storing sensitive data. However, Dropbox can be useful for storing non-sensitive data that is actively being worked on, and it provides convenient versioning and recovery options. Dropbox can be accessed on Klone via rclone.\n\n\n\nGitHub is a web-based hosting service for version control using Git. Files up to 100 MiB each can be stored in a GitHub repository. The total size of a repository should be under 5 GiB.\nGitHub repositories can be made publicly available or can be made private. Private repositories are only accessible to collaborators who have been granted access to the repository. Private repositories are only available to collaborators who have GitHub accounts. GitHub repositories can be accessed from the GitHub website or the GitHub Desktop application.\n\n\nGitHub Releases can be used to store files up to 2 GiB in size each.\n\n\n\nGitHub Packages can be used to create container that can be uploaded to the GitHub Container Registry. For public repositories, there are no charges nor storage limits. For private repositories, storage limits and charges apply. A GitHub account is required to access GitHub Packages.\nAlthough GitHub Packages is not designed to store research data, it can be used to store research data in the form of a container containing an archive of research data (similar to a ZIP file). The data cannot be viewed or modified while stored in GitHub Packages, but can be downloaded and extracted from the container. Any changes to the data require creating a new image and uploading it to GitHub Packages.\nPublic packages can be accessed by anyone and should not be used for sensitive data. However, it may be possible to encrypt data before storing it in the image or to deploy an encrypted container.\n\n\n\nGitHub has a Large File Storage (LFS) extension that can be used to store large files in a GitHub repository.\nAccording to GitHub’s documentation, the file size limits for GitHub repositories are:\n\n\n\nPlan\nMaximum file size\n\n\n\n\nGitHub Free\n2 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Pro\n2 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Team\n4 GiB\n\n\nGitHub Enterprise Cloud\n5 GiB",

    "text": "hyakvnc is a program to create and manage VNC sessions running within an Apptainer environment on a compute node. # hyakvnc\nhyakvnc – A tool for launching VNC sessions on Hyak.\nhyakvnc is a command-line tool that makes it easy to start a graphical VNC session on the University of Washington Hyak cluster, allowing you to interact with the system in a point-and-click environment, with support for graphical applications such as Freesurfer. hyakvnc sessions run in Apptainer containers, which provide reproducible environments that can run anywhere and be shared with other researchers.\nIf you’re already familiar with Hyak and VNC and you just want to install hyakvnc immediately, you can skip to the quick install section.\n\n\nBefore running hyakvnc, you’ll need the following:\n\nA Linux, macOS, or Windows machine\nThe OpenSSH client (usually included with Linux and macOS, and available for Windows via WSL2 or Cygwin [note that the Windows 10+ built-in OpenSSH client will not work])\nA VNC client/viewer (TurboVNC viewer is recommended for all platforms)\nHyak Klone access with compute resources\nA private SSH key on your local machine which has been added to the authorized keys on the login node of the Hyak Klone cluster (see below)\nA HyakVNC-compatible Apptainer container image in a directory on Hyak (usually with the file extension .sif) or the URL to one (e.g,., oras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-vncserver-ubuntu22.04:latest)\n\nFollow the instructions below to set up your machine correctly:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Linux, OpenSSH is probably installed already – if not, you can install it via apt-get install openssh-client on Debian/Ubuntu or yum install openssh-clients on RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora. To open a terminal window, search for “Terminal” in your desktop environment’s application launcher.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. On Debian/Ubuntu, you will need to download the file ending with arm64.deb. On RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora, you will need to download the file ending with x86_64.rpm. Then, install it by running sudo dpkg -i &lt;filename&gt; on Debian/Ubuntu or sudo rpm -i &lt;filename&gt; on RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora.\n\n\n\nIf you’re on macOS, OpenSSH will already be installed. To open a terminal window, open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app or search for “Terminal” in Launchpad or Spotlight.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. On an M1 Mac (newer), you will need to download the file ending with arm64.dmg. On an Intel Mac (older), you will need the file ending with x86_64.dmg. Then, open the .dmg file and launch the installer inside.\n\n\n\nWindows needs a little more setup. You’ll need to install a terminal emulator as well as the OpenSSH client. The easiest way to do this is to install WSL2 (recommended for Windows versions 10+, comes with the OpenSSH client already installed) or Cygwin (not recommended, needs additional setup). See the links for instructions on how to install these. You can start a terminal window by searching for “Terminal” in the Start menu.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. You will need the file ending with x64.exe. Run the program to install TurboVNC.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you are allowed to connect to a compute node where your VNC session will be running, you must add your SSH public key to the authorized keys on the login node of the Hyak Klone cluster.\nIf you don’t, you will receive an error like this when you try to connect:\nPermission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)\nTo set this up quickly on Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2/Cygwin), open a new terminal window on your machine and enter the following 2 commands before you try again. Replace your-uw-netid with your UW NetID:\n[ ! -r ~/.ssh/id_rsa ] && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -C \"your-uw-netid@uw.edu\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \"your-uw-netid\"@klone.hyak.uw.edu\nSee https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/setup/intracluster-keys for more information.\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to find a HyakVNC-compatible container image to run your VNC session in. The following images are provided by us and can be used with hyakvnc by copying and pasting the URL into the hyakvnc create command:\n\noras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-vncserver-ubuntu22.04:latest – Ubuntu 22.04 with TurboVNC\noras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-freesurfer-ubuntu22.04:latest – Ubuntu 22.04 with TurboVNC and Freesurfer\n\n\n\n\n\nhyakvnc should be installed on the login node of the Hyak Klone cluster.\nTo connect to the login node, you’ll need to enter the following command into a terminal window (replacing your-uw-netid with your UW NetID) and provide your password when prompted:\nssh your-uw-netid@klone.hyak.uw.edu\n\n\nAfter you’ve connected to the login node, you can download and install hyakvnc by running the following command. Copy and paste it into the terminal window where you are connected to the login node and press enter:\neval \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uw-psych/hyakvnc/main/install.sh)\"\nThis will download and install hyakvnc to your ~/.local/bin directory and add it to your $PATH so you can run it by typing hyakvnc into the terminal window.\n\n\n\nIn a terminal window connected to a login node, enter this command to clone the repository and navigate into the repository directory:\ngit clone --depth 1 --single-branch https://github.com/uw-psych/hyakvnc && cd hyakvnc\nThen, run the following command to install hyakvnc:\n./hyakvnc install\nIf you prefer, you may continue to use hyakvnc from the directory where you cloned it by running ./hyakvnc from that directory instead of using the command hyakvnc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a VNC session with the hyakvnc create command followed by arguments to specify the container. In this example, we’ll use a basic container for a graphical environment from the HyakVNC GitHub Container Registry:\nhyakvnc create --container oras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-vncserver-ubuntu22.04:latest\nIt may take a few minutes to download the container if you’re running it the first time. If successful, hyakvnc should print commands and instructions to connect:\n==========\nCopy and paste these instructions into a command line terminal on your local machine to connect to the VNC session.\nYou may need to install a VNC client if you don't already have one.\n\nNOTE: If you receive an error that looks like \"Permission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)\", you don't have an SSH key set up.\nSee https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/setup/intracluster-keys for more information.\nTo set this up quickly on Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2/Cygwin), open a new terminal window on your machine and enter the following 2 commands before you try again:\n\n[ ! -r ~/.ssh/id_rsa ] && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -C \"your-uw-netid@uw.edu\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no your-uw-netid@klone.hyak.uw.edu\n---------\nLINUX TERMINAL (bash/zsh):\nssh -f -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -L 5901:/mmfs1/home/your-uw-netid/.hyakvnc/jobs/15042104/vnc/socket.uds -J your-uw-netid@klone.hyak.uw.edu your-uw-netid@g3053 sleep 20 && vncviewer localhost:5901 || xdg-open vnc://localhost:5901 || echo 'No VNC viewer found.

    "text": "Before running hyakvnc, you’ll need the following:\n\nA Linux, macOS, or Windows machine\nThe OpenSSH client (usually included with Linux and macOS, and available for Windows via WSL2 or Cygwin [note that the Windows 10+ built-in OpenSSH client will not work])\nA VNC client/viewer (TurboVNC viewer is recommended for all platforms)\nHyak Klone access with compute resources\nA private SSH key on your local machine which has been added to the authorized keys on the login node of the Hyak Klone cluster (see below)\nA HyakVNC-compatible Apptainer container image in a directory on Hyak (usually with the file extension .sif) or the URL to one (e.g,., oras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-vncserver-ubuntu22.04:latest)\n\nFollow the instructions below to set up your machine correctly:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are using Linux, OpenSSH is probably installed already – if not, you can install it via apt-get install openssh-client on Debian/Ubuntu or yum install openssh-clients on RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora. To open a terminal window, search for “Terminal” in your desktop environment’s application launcher.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. On Debian/Ubuntu, you will need to download the file ending with arm64.deb. On RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora, you will need to download the file ending with x86_64.rpm. Then, install it by running sudo dpkg -i &lt;filename&gt; on Debian/Ubuntu or sudo rpm -i &lt;filename&gt; on RHEL/CentOS/Rocky/Fedora.\n\n\n\nIf you’re on macOS, OpenSSH will already be installed. To open a terminal window, open /Applications/Utilities/Terminal.app or search for “Terminal” in Launchpad or Spotlight.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. On an M1 Mac (newer), you will need to download the file ending with arm64.dmg. On an Intel Mac (older), you will need the file ending with x86_64.dmg. Then, open the .dmg file and launch the installer inside.\n\n\n\nWindows needs a little more setup. You’ll need to install a terminal emulator as well as the OpenSSH client. The easiest way to do this is to install WSL2 (recommended for Windows versions 10+, comes with the OpenSSH client already installed) or Cygwin (not recommended, needs additional setup). See the links for instructions on how to install these. You can start a terminal window by searching for “Terminal” in the Start menu.\nTo install TurboVNC, download the latest version from here. You will need the file ending with x64.exe. Run the program to install TurboVNC.\n\n\n\n\nBefore you are allowed to connect to a compute node where your VNC session will be running, you must add your SSH public key to the authorized keys on the login node of the Hyak Klone cluster.\nIf you don’t, you will receive an error like this when you try to connect:\nPermission denied (publickey,gssapi-keyex,gssapi-with-mic)\nTo set this up quickly on Linux, macOS, or Windows (WSL2/Cygwin), open a new terminal window on your machine and enter the following 2 commands before you try again. Replace your-uw-netid with your UW NetID:\n[ ! -r ~/.ssh/id_rsa ] && ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -N '' -C \"your-uw-netid@uw.edu\" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa\nssh-copy-id -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa \"your-uw-netid\"@klone.hyak.uw.edu\nSee https://hyak.uw.edu/docs/setup/intracluster-keys for more information.\n\n\n\nYou’ll need to find a HyakVNC-compatible container image to run your VNC session in. The following images are provided by us and can be used with hyakvnc by copying and pasting the URL into the hyakvnc create command:\n\noras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-vncserver-ubuntu22.04:latest – Ubuntu 22.04 with TurboVNC\noras://ghcr.io/maouw/hyakvnc_apptainer/hyakvnc-freesurfer-ubuntu22.04:latest – Ubuntu 22.04 with TurboVNC and Freesurfer",

There should be no spaces between the variable name, the equals sign, and the value.\nThe following variables are available:\n\nHYAKVNC_DIR: Local directory to store application data (default: $HOME/.hyakvnc)\nHYAKVNC_CONFIG_FILE: Configuration file to use (default: $HYAKVNC_DIR/hyakvnc-config.env)\nHYAKVNC_CHECK_UPDATE_FREQUENCY: How often to check for updates in [d]ays or [m]inutes (default: 0 for every time. Use 1d for daily, 10m for every 10 minutes, etc. -1 to disable.)\nHYAKVNC_LOG_FILE: Log file to use (default: $HYAKVNC_DIR/hyakvnc.log)\nHYAKVNC_LOG_LEVEL: Log level to use for interactive output (default: INFO)\nHYAKVNC_LOG_FILE_LEVEL: Log level to use for log file output (default: DEBUG)\nHYAKVNC_SSH_HOST: Default SSH host to use for connection strings (default: klone.hyak.uw.edu)\nHYAKVNC_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: Seconds to wait for most commands to complete before timing out (default: 30)\nHYAKVNC_VNC_PASSWORD: Password to use for new VNC sessions (default: password)\nHYAKVNC_VNC_DISPLAY: VNC display to use (default: :1)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_CONTAINERS_DIR: Directory to look for apptainer containers (default: (none))\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_GHCR_ORAS_PRELOAD: Whether to preload SIF files from the ORAS GitHub Container Registry (default: 0)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_BIN: Name of apptainer binary (default: apptainer)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_CONTAINER: Path to container image to use (default: (none; set by --container option))\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_APP_VNCSERVER: Name of app in the container that starts the VNC session (default: vncserver)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_APP_VNCKILL: Name of app that cleanly stops the VNC session in the container (default: vnckill)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_WRITABLE_TMPFS: Whether to use a writable tmpfs for the container (default: 1)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_CLEANENV: Whether to use a clean environment for the container (default: 1)\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_ADD_BINDPATHS: Bind paths to add to the container (default: (none))\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_ADD_ENVVARS: Environment variables to add to before invoking apptainer (default: (none))\nHYAKVNC_APPTAINER_ADD_ARGS: Additional arguments to give apptainer (default: (none))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_JOB_PREFIX: Prefix to use for hyakvnc SLURM job names (default: hyakvnc-)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_SUBMIT_TIMEOUT: Seconds after submitting job to wait for the job to start before timing out (default: 120)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_OUTPUT_DIR: Directory to store SLURM output files (default: $HYAKVNC_DIR/slurm-output)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_OUTPUT: Where to send SLURM job output (default: $HYAKVNC_SLURM_OUTPUT_DIR/job-%j.out)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_JOB_NAME: What to name the launched SLURM job (default: (set according to container name))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_ACCOUNT: Slurm account to use (default: (autodetected))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_PARTITION: Slurm partition to use (default: (autodetected))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_CLUSTER: Slurm cluster to use (default: (autodetected))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_GPUS: Number of GPUs to request (default: (none))\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_MEM: Amount of memory to request, in [M]egabytes or [G]igabytes (default: 4G)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_CPUS: Number of CPUs to request (default: 4)\nHYAKVNC_SLURM_TIMELIMIT: Time limit for SLURM job (default: 12:00:00)",

    "title": "Storage on Klone",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Klone has a number of storage options available to users. This page describes the options and best practices for using them.\n\n\nThe Klone cluster makes available several locations for storing data, some of which are shared across the login nodes and compute nodes, and some of which are only available to the node where a job is running.\n\n\nThe following storage locations are shared across the login nodes and compute nodes:\n\n\nEvery user on Klone has a home directory, which is the default location for storing files. The home directory is located at /mmfs1/home/&lt;username&gt;. The home directory is where you are when you log in to the login node, and it is also acessible by any compute node where you have a job running.\n\nNone of the storage locations on Klone are backed up. If you need to store data that you cannot afford to lose, you should use a different storage location – see our guide to storage for more information.\n\nCurrently, there is a 10 GiB quota on the home directory. This quota is enforced by the system, and you will not be able to write to your home directory if you exceed it. You can check your quota with the hyakstorage command when you are logged in to any Klone node:\n1hyakstorage --home\n\n1\n\nThe --home flag tells hyakstorage to check your home directory quota.\n\n\nThe result will look something like this:\n                       Usage report for /mmfs1/home/altan\n╭───────────────────┬────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────╮\n│                   │ Disk Usage                 │ Files Usage                 │\n├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤\n│ Total:            │ 1GB / 10GB                 │ 11579 / 256000 files        │\n│                   │ 10%                        │ 5%                          │\n╰───────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────╯\nIt is important to note that the home directory is not intended for storing large amounts of data. If you need to store more than a few GiB of data, you should use one of the other storage options described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault software installation locations\n\n\n\nA lot of software will save files to your home directory by default. Python, for example, will install packages to ~/.local/lib/python3.6 by default when they are installed using pip install --user. Apptainer will also cache images in ~/.apptainer/cache by default.

If you exceed this limit, you will not be able to write to the filesystem. Furthermore, because of the way that the software underlying the filesystem (GPFS) works, having or accessing a large number of files can slow down the filesystem for everyone.\nSome software is prone to creating a large number of files – pip and conda are common culprits. If you are using software that creates a large number of files, you should consider using Apptainer to run your software in a container. The files installed by the software will be compressed and stored in a single file (the container image), which will reduce the number of files on the filesystem and potentially speed up your software.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is also a directory /gscratch/scrubbed, which is a scratch directory where any data not accessed in 21 days is automatically deleted. This directory is slower than other directories under /gscratch. There is no quota on this directory, but you should not store data here that you cannot afford to lose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding large or old files\n\n\n\nYou can browse through the largest files and directories in any directory using the gdu command, which you can load using module load escience/gdu when logged in to a compute node.\nIf you want to look up files nobody has accessed in a while, you can use the find command. The following command will find all files in the current directory that have not been accessed in the last 14 days (atime +14) and are larger than 1 MiB (-size +1M):\nfind . -atime +14 -size +1M -printf '%AFT%AH:%AM\\t%s\\t%p\\n' | \\\n1    awk '{printf \"%s\\t%dM\\t%s\\n\", $1, $2/(1024*1024), $3}'\n\n1\n\nWe use awk to process the file size in bytes that find reports and convert it to MiB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhttps://hyak.uw.edu/blog/klone-storage-update\nhttps://hyak.uw.edu/docs/storage",

    "text": "The Klone cluster makes available several locations for storing data, some of which are shared across the login nodes and compute nodes, and some of which are only available to the node where a job is running.\n\n\nThe following storage locations are shared across the login nodes and compute nodes:\n\n\nEvery user on Klone has a home directory, which is the default location for storing files. The home directory is located at /mmfs1/home/&lt;username&gt;. The home directory is where you are when you log in to the login node, and it is also acessible by any compute node where you have a job running.\n\nNone of the storage locations on Klone are backed up. If you need to store data that you cannot afford to lose, you should use a different storage location – see our guide to storage for more information.\n\nCurrently, there is a 10 GiB quota on the home directory. This quota is enforced by the system, and you will not be able to write to your home directory if you exceed it. You can check your quota with the hyakstorage command when you are logged in to any Klone node:\n1hyakstorage --home\n\n1\n\nThe --home flag tells hyakstorage to check your home directory quota.\n\n\nThe result will look something like this:\n                       Usage report for /mmfs1/home/altan\n╭───────────────────┬────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────╮\n│                   │ Disk Usage                 │ Files Usage                 │\n├───────────────────┼────────────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤\n│ Total:            │ 1GB / 10GB                 │ 11579 / 256000 files        │\n│                   │ 10%                        │ 5%                          │\n╰───────────────────┴────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────╯\nIt is important to note that the home directory is not intended for storing large amounts of data. If you need to store more than a few GiB of data, you should use one of the other storage options described below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault software installation locations\n\n\n\nA lot of software will save files to your home directory by default. Python, for example, will install packages to ~/.local/lib/python3.6 by default when they are installed using pip install --user. Apptainer will also cache images in ~/.apptainer/cache by default.

    "section": "",
    "text": "A number of concepts and terms are used when discussing research data storage. This page provides an overview of some of the most common concepts and terms.\n\n\nThere are many different types of storage. Some of the most common types of storage are:\n\n\nObject storage is a type of storage that stores data as objects. Each object contains data, metadata, and a unique identifier. Objects are stored in a flat address space and can be accessed using a URL. Object storage is designed to store large amounts of unstructured data. Object storage is not designed to be used as a file system. Object storage is typically accessed using a REST API. Object storage is typically used for storing data that is not actively being worked on but needs to be stored for a long time. Amazon S3 and Azure Blobs are examples of object storage services.\n\n\n\nBlock storage is a type of storage that stores data as blocks. Each block contains data and a unique identifier. Blocks are stored in a hierarchical address space and can be accessed using a file system. Block storage is designed to store large amounts of structured data. Block storage is typically used for storing data that is actively being worked on. Amazon EBS is an example of block storage.\n\n\n\nFile storage is a type of storage that stores data as files. Your computer’s local filesystem uses file storage. Network filesystems such as NFS and SMB, and cloud storage services such as Azure Files and Amazon EFS also use file storage. File storage is designed to store large amounts of structured data. File storage is designed to be used by multiple users at the same time and supports creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. File storage is typically used for storing data that is actively being worked on. Azure Files is an example of file storage.\n\n\nCloud-based file sync services, such as Dropbox, Google Drive, and OneDrive, offer file storage that can easily be accessed from multiple devices. These services usually offer convenient features such as file versioning, recovery, and file sharing. You can access the files stored in these services from a directory on your computer, and the files are automatically synchronized with the cloud storage service. However, the services may not support all of the features of a traditional file system (e.g., file permissions, symbolic links) and often have restrictions on the length of file names and the types of characters that can be used in file names, which may cause serious problems when using files stored in these services with some applications (e.g., FreeSurfer). Caution is advised when working with files stored in these services.\n\n\n\n\nVersion control systems, such as Git, are designed to store and manage different versions of files. Version control systems are typically used for storing source code but can also be used for storing other types of files. There are some version control systems that are designed to handle datasets, such as DVC. GitHub provides online hosting and collaboration services for Git repositories.\n\n\n\nData repositories, such as ResearchWorks Archive and OSF, are designed to store and manage research data and their metadata. Data repositories are typically used for storing data that is being shared with other researchers. Data repositories often provide features such as versioning, recovery, sharing, and embargos. Data repositories often provide a DOI for each dataset, which can be used to cite the dataset in publications.\n\n\n\n\nThere are a number of characteristics and considerations that are important when choosing a storage service, and these may be reflected in the upfront and ongoing costs. Some of the most common characteristics and considerations are:\n\n\nHow much data is being stored. The more data that is being stored, the more it will cost to store the data. Storage services may have minimum and/or maximum storage capacity requirements. Some services may charge for storage in increments of a certain size (e.g., 1 TiB).\n\n\n\nHow quickly data can start being read or written. The lower the latency, the faster data can be read or written. Storage services may charge more for lower latency. A solid-state drive (SSD) has lower latency than a hard disk drive (HDD), which has lower latency than a tape drive. However, storage capacity on SSDs is more expensive than storage capacity on HDDs, which is more expensive than storage capacity on tape drives.\n\n\n\nThe rate at which data can be downloaded from or uploaded to a service may be limited. The higher the bandwidth, the faster data can be downloaded from or uploaded to the service. Service providers may charge more for higher bandwidth.\nData transfer costs may be charged for uploading data to and downloading data from a service, also known as ingress and egress. Typically, ingress is free and egress is charged. Some services may charge more for uploading data to and downloading data from certain locations (e.g., outside of the United States). Some providers offer options such as physical media transfer (e.g., mailing a hard drive) for uploading and downloading large amounts of data (see AWS Snowball).\n\n\n\nHow long data needs to be stored. The longer data needs to be stored, the more it will cost to store the data. Billing for storage services is typically done on a monthly or annual basis.\n\n\n\nHow often data is backed up, how long backups are kept, and how quickly data can be recovered from backups. The more often data is backed up, the longer backups are kept, and the faster data can be recovered from backups, the more it will cost to store the data. Backup and recovery options may not be available or involve extra charges on some services.\n\n\n\nHow often data is accessed. Some services may charge for each time data is accessed or charge more for more frequent access.\n\n\n\nWho can access the data. Data access restrictions may be inherent to a service (e.g., only people connected to the UW intranet can access the data) or may be imposed by the user, the organization, or the service provider. Sharing data with outside collaborators may require additional steps, such as creating accounts for the collaborators, or may not be possible at all.\n\n\n\nHow secure the data is against unauthorized access. While access restrictions can limit who can access the data in certain circumstances, measures such as encryption may be necessary to prevent access by users who have access to the data but should not be able to access the data (e.g., system administrators).\nResearch data that is subject to HIPAA or FERPA regulations must be stored in a HIPAA- or FERPA-compliant service.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Apptainer (formerly Singularity) is a simple container platform enabling users to install and run software that would otherwise be unsupported by the host environment.\nOn Klone, the apptainer command is available on all compute nodes, but it is not available on the login node.\nBy default, the apptainer command will use the system version of Apptainer:\nwhich apptainer # prints /usr/bin/apptainer\napptainer --version # apptainer version 1.2.4-1.el8 (as of 2023-12-05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading a different version of Apptainer using Lmod\n\n\n\n\n\nTo use a different version of Apptainer, load the appropriate Lmod module. For example, to use Apptainer version 1.1.5:\nmodule load apptainer/1.1.5\nwhich apptainer # prints /sw/apptainer/1.1.5/bin/apptainer\napptainer --version # apptainer version 1.1.5\nTo see all available versions of Apptainer, run:\nmodule -t spider apptainer\nThe default module is indicated by the tag (D) following the version. For example, apptainer/local (D) indicates that the default version is local. (The local version is the version installed on the system.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApptainer containers are designed to be portable, so by default, they do not have access to all the files on the host system. To make files available to the container, you must bind them to the container. This is done using the --bind option of the apptainer command or the APPTAINER_BINDPATH environment variable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefault bind paths\n\n\n\nBy default, apptainer will make several directories available within the container by binding them to the same path in the container so that /somefolder on the host is available as /somefolder within the container.\nThese directories include:\n\n$HOME (your home directory, a.k.a. ~)\n/tmp (temporary directory – unique to each node; contents are purged when the users’ last job running on the node completes)\n$PWD (the current working directory, i.e., the directory you are in when you run apptainer)\n\nThe Klone Apptainer installation is also configured to bind several other directories to the same path in the container, including:\n\n/mmfs1 (the main filesystem)\n/scr (the scratch filesystem, same as /tmp)\n\n\n\nWe recommend setting the following binds before running a container:\nexport APPTAINER_BINDPATH=\"/gscratch\" # Make /gscratch available within the container\nTo start an Apptainer container interactively, run the following:\napptainer shell &lt;path_to_container&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\napptainer pull docker://&lt;image_name&gt;[:&lt;tag&gt;] # Pulls the image from docker registry\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s try running a Python script using Apptainer. The release notes for Python version 3.11 say that it is “between 10-60% faster than Python 3.10”. Is this true? Let’s find out! We’ll write a simple Python script to test this and use Apptainer to run it on Python 3.10 and Python 3.11.\n\n\nspeedtest.py\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os, sys, timeit\n\n# Get the values of the environment variables M and N, or use default values:\n1n = int(os.getenv(\"N\", default=1000))  # How many numbers to join\nm = int(os.getenv(\"M\", default=100))  # How many times to run the test\n\n# Function to test:\ndef join_nums():\n    return \"-\".join([str(i) for i in range(n)])\n\n2# Print details about the test to stderr:\nprint(\n    f\"Running join_nums() {n}*{m} times on Python v{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\",\n    file=sys.stderr,\n)\n\n# Run the test:\n3result = timeit.timeit(join_nums, number=m)\n\n# Print the result:\n4print(result)\n\n\n1\n\nThe os.getenv function retrieves the value of an environment variable or returns a default value if the variable is not set.\n\n2\n\nHere, we use the file parameter to print(), which makes it write to the standard error stream (stderr) instead of the default standard output stream (stdout). This is useful because we want to print the result of the test to stdout so that we can save the output by redirecting it to a file, but we also want to print some information about the test to stderr so that it doesn’t get mixed up with the result.\n\n3\n\ntimeit.timeit() runs a function multiple times and returns the average time it took to run the function.\n\n4\n\nThe print function prints to the standard output stream (stdout) by default. We can redirect this to a file in bash using the &gt; operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to paste and save a file in the terminal\n\n\n\nYou can use the nano command to create a new file and paste the contents of the file into the terminal. To do this, run nano &lt;filename&gt; in the terminal, paste the contents of the file into the terminal, and press Ctrl+X to exit. You will be asked if you want to save the file. Press Y to save the file and Enter to confirm the filename.\n\n\nNow let’s run the script using Python 3.10 and Python 3.11. For the image, we will use the python:3.10-slim and python:3.11-slim images from the official Python images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged container releases\n\n\n\nThe python:3.10-slim and python:3.11-slim images are tagged with the version of Python they contain. This means that if you pull the python:3.10-slim image today, it will always contain Python 3.10, even if Python 3.11 is released tomorrow.\nThe python:*-slim images are designed to contain only the minimal set of packages required to run Python and are much smaller than the standard Python images (~45 MiB vs ~350 MiB).\n\n\nWe’ll use the apptainer exec command to run the script inside an Apptainer container:\n1apptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py\n\n1\n\nThe apptainer exec command runs a command inside an Apptainer container. The docker://python:3.10-slim argument tells Apptainer to use the python:3.10-slim image from the Docker registry. The python3 ./speedtest.py argument tells Apptainer to run the python3 command inside the container and provide it with the argument speedtest.py.\n\n\nYou should see something like:\n1Running join_nums() 1000*100 times on Python v3.10\n20.003154174002702348\n\n1\n\nThis is printed to stderr because we used print(..., file=sys.stderr) in the script.\n\n2\n\nThis is printed to stdout.\n\n\nIt probably didn’t take very long to run the script. Let’s try running it again with larger values of M and N. We can set the values of M and N by setting them as environment variables in the bash command prompt before running the script:\n1export M=1000 N=100_000\napptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py\n\n1\n\nThe export command sets the values of the M and N environment variables and makes them available to other programs like apptainer. We’re setting N to 100_000 instead of 100000 because underscores can be used in Python to make large numbers easier to read. This is a feature of Python, not the shell (which interprets 100_000 as just a string and not a number).\n\n\nIt should take a bit longer to run this time.\nNow, let’s try running the script using Python 3.11:\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest.py\nWe don’t need to set the values of M and N again because they are still set from the previous command via export (unless you closed your terminal window or logged out).\nIt probably took a bit less time to run the script this time.\nIs Python 3.11 really faster than Python 3.10? Let’s find out by redirecting the output of the script to a file:\n1apptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py &gt; py3.10.txt\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest.py &gt; py3.11.txt\n2cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt # show the results\n\n1\n\nIn bash, the &gt; operator redirects the output of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If you want to append to an existing file instead, use the &gt;&gt; operator. These operators can be used with any command, not just apptainer. For example, ls &gt; my_files.txt will write the output of ls to the file my_files.txt.\n\n2\n\nThe cat command prints the contents of a file to&gt; stdout. If you want to print the contents of multiple files, you can list them all as arguments to cat.\n\n\nWe see the results, but they’re not very easy to interpret. Let’s pipe the output to Python to calculate the speedup:\n1cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt | apptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'\n\n1\n\nThe | operator pipes the output of one command to the input of another. In this case, we are piping the output of cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt to the input of apptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'. The -c option of the python3 command tells Python to run the code provided as an argument. The code print(float(input())/float(input())) reads two lines of input from standard input, converts them to floating point numbers, divides the first by the second, and prints the result.\n\n\nIn my case, Python 3.11 was about 1.3 times faster than Python 3.10. Not bad!\nHere’s a demo of the above commands. Note that I used M=200 and N=50_000 instead of M=1000 and N=100_000 because it takes a long time to run the script with the larger values of M and N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to add a command-line interface to make it possible to run the script with different values of M and N without having to set them as environment variables? A user might want to set the values of M and N as command-line arguments. Maybe they would also like to be able to specify the output file instead of redirecting the output to a file. And how about a progress bar? Users love progress bars!\nThis sounds like a tall order, but it’s quite easy to do in Python using the click package for Python. Here’s the new script:\n\n\nspeedtest-cli.py\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os, sys, timeit\nimport click\n\n\n# Set up the context for the command line interface and add the options:\n@click.command()\n@click.option(\n    \"-n\",  # The name of the option\n    envvar=\"N\",  # Use the environment variable `N` if it exists\n    default=1000,  # Default value if `N` is not set\n    help=\"How many numbers to join\",  # Help text for the `-n` option\n    type=int,  # Convert the value to an integer\n)\n@click.option(\n    \"-m\",\n    envvar=\"M\",\n    default=100,\n    help=\"How many times to run the test\",\n    type=int,\n)\n@click.option(\n    \"--output\",\n1    default=\"/dev/stdout\",  # Write the result to stdout by default\n    help=\"Path to the output file\",\n2    type=click.Path(writable=True, dir_okay=False),\n)\n3def speedtest(m, n, output):\n    \"\"\"Run a speed test.\"\"\"  # Help text for the command\n\n    def join_nums():  # The function to test\n        return \"-\".join([str(i) for i in range(n)])\n\n    print(f\"Running join_nums() {n}*{m} times on Python v{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    bar = click.progressbar(  # Create a progress bar\n        length=n * m,\n        update_min_steps=n,  # Update the progress bar every `n` steps\n        file=sys.stderr,  # Print the progress bar to stderr\n    )\n\n    def join_nums_progress():  # Wrap the function to add the progress bar\n        result = join_nums()\n        bar.update(n)  # Increment the progress bar by `n` steps\n        return result\n\n    result = timeit.timeit(join_nums_progress, number=m)  # Run the test\n\n    bar.render_finish()  # Stop rendering the progress bar\n\n    with open(output, \"w\") as f:  # Open the output file for writing\n        print(result, file=f)  # Write the result to the output file\n\n    if output != \"/dev/stdout\":  # Show the output path if it's not stdout\n        print(f\"Result written to {output}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n\n4if __name__ == \"__main__\":  # Run the script if it's executed directly\n    speedtest()\n\n\n1\n\nWe set the default value of --output to /dev/stdout so that the script will print the result to stdout by default.\n\n2\n\nclick provides a Path type that can be used to validate paths. The writable=True option tells click that the path must be writable. The dir_okay=False option tells click that the path must not be a directory.\n\n3\n\nThe @click.command() decorator tells click that the first function definition that follows defines a command. The @click.option() decorators add options to the command-line interface. click passes the values of these options to the function using the names of the options (lowercased and with - replaced by _).\n\n4\n\nThe __name__ == \"__main__\" check ensures that the script is only run if it is executed directly and not if it is imported as a module. This is useful if you want to use the script as a module in another script. We don’t need to do this here, but it’s a good habit to get into.\n\n\nNow, let’s try running the script with apptainer exec:\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest-cli.py\nYou probably got a ModuleNotFoundError because the click package is not installed in the python:3.11-slim image. If you know some Python, you might think, “I could probably fix this if I install the click module via pip.” And you would be right – if you were running the script in the version of Python that’s normally installed on your computer. But we’re running the script inside an Apptainer container, so we need to install the click module inside the container. Furthermore, we’re using two different versions of Python, so we need to install the click module in the containers for both versions.\nWe’ll solve this by writing an Apptainer definition file to build a custom Apptainer image that contains the click module. Here’s the definition file:\n\n\nspeedtest.def\n\n1Bootstrap: docker # Where to get the base image from.\n2From: python:{{ PY_VERSION }}-slim # Which container to use as a base image.\n\n3%arguments\n    # The version of Python to use:\n    PY_VERSION=3.10\n  \n%files\n4    speedtest-cli.py /opt/local/bin/speedtest # Copy the script to the container.\n\n5%post\n    # Create a virtual environment in /opt/venv to install our dependencies:\n6    /usr/local/bin/python -m venv /opt/venv\n\n    # Install `click` and don't cache the downloaded files:\n7    /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir click\n\n    # Print a message to stderr to let the user know that the installation is done:\n8    echo \"$(/opt/venv/bin/python3 --version): Done installing dependencies.\" &gt;&2\n\n    # Make the `speedtest` command executable:\n9    chmod +x /opt/local/bin/speedtest\n\n10%environment\n11    export PATH=\"/opt/local/bin:$PATH\" # Add the directory with the `speedtest` command to the PATH.\n12    export PATH=\"/opt/venv/bin:$PATH\" # Add the virtual environment to the PATH.\n\n13%runscript\n    # Run the Python script with the arguments passed to the container:\n14    speedtest \"$@\"\n\n15%test\n    # Run the speedtest command to check if it works:\n    speedtest -m 2000 -n 1000\n\n\n1\n\nEach definition file must start with a Bootstrap line that tells Apptainer where to get the base image from. In this case, we’re using the docker bootstrap, which means that we’re getting the base image from the Docker registry.\n\n2\n\nWe’re using the python:{{ PY_VERSION }} image as the base image. The { PY_VERSION } part refers to a template variable and will be replaced with the value of the PY_VERSION build argument when we build the image. This means we can use the same definition file to build images for different versions of Python.\n\n3\n\nThe definition file is split into sections. The %arguments section defines the build arguments for the image. We’re using the PY_VERSION argument to specify the version of Python to use, and we’re setting the default value to 3.10.\n\n4\n\nThe %files section defines the files to copy inside the container. We’re copying the speedtest-cli.py script to /opt/local/bin/speedtest in the container. /opt/local/bin is a good place to put scripts that you want to be able to run from anywhere in the container, but you should add the directory to the PATH environment variable if you want to be able to run the script without specifying the full path to the script. We’re removing the .py extension from the script name because we want to be able to run the script by typing speedtest instead of speedtest-cli.py.\n\n5\n\nThe %post section defines the commands to run inside the container after the base image has been downloaded. This is where you should install any dependencies that your script needs.\n\n6\n\nWe’re using the python -m venv command to create a virtual environment in /opt/venv, which is where we will install the click module.\n\n7\n\nWe run pip from the virtual environment to install the click module. We use the --no-cache-dir option to tell pip not to cache the downloaded files. This is useful because we don’t need the downloaded files after we’ve installed the click module – otherwise, they would just take up space in the built image.\n\n8\n\nWe’re using the echo command to print a message to stderr to let the user know that the installation is done. We’re using the &gt;&2 operator to redirect the output of echo to stderr instead of stdout. The $(...) syntax runs the commands within and inserts the output into a string. In this case, we’re using it to insert the output of python3 --version into the string we’re about to print with echo. This helps the user know which version of Python the built image will contain.\n\n9\n\nWe’re using the chmod command to make the speedtest command executable – otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to run it without passing it to the python3 command.\n\n10\n\nThe %environment section defines the environment variables to set in the container. Note that the environment variables set in the %environment section are only set when the container is run. They are not set when the image is built, so they are not available in the %post section, even if you move the %environment section above the %post section.\n\n11\n\nWe’re prepending /opt/local/bin to the existing value of the PATH environment variable so that we can run the speedtest command from anywhere in the container. The PATH environment variable is used by the shell to find commands. If you want to be able to run a command without specifying the full path to the command, you need to add the directory containing the command to the PATH environment variable, separated by a colon (:).\n\n12\n\nAdding the /opt/venv/bin directory to the PATH environment variable makes it possible to run the python command from the virtual environment we created in the %post section. This is necessary because we installed the click module in the virtual environment, so we need to run the python command from the virtual environment to be able to import the click module.\n\n13\n\nThe %runscript section defines the command to run when the container is run. In this case, we’re running the speedtest command we installed in the %post section.\n\n14\n\nWe’re using the $@ special parameter to pass all the arguments passed to the container to the speedtest command – for example, if you run apptainer exec speedtest.sif --output output.txt, the speedtest command will be run with the arguments --output output.txt.\n\n15\n\nThe %test section defines the command to run when the image is built. In this case, we’re running the speedtest command to make sure that it works.\n\n\nNow we can build the image using the apptainer build command. The first argument is the name of the image to build. The second argument is the path to the definition file:\napptainer build speedtest-py3.10.sif speedtest.def\nIt might take a little while to build the image. If everything goes according to plan, you should see the output of a test run at the end of the build process when the %test section is run.\nWhen it’s done, the image will be saved as speedtest-py3.10.sif in the current directory. This image encapsulates the script and all its dependencies, so we can run it on any system that has Apptainer installed without having to worry about whether the system has a specific version of Python or the click module installed. Furthermore, because we defined a %runscript section in the definition file, we can run the script without having to specify the python3 command.\nTo run the containerized script, we can run the apptainer run command, which is similar to apptainer exec but launches the commands in the %runscript section of the definition file instead of the command specified as an argument:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif\nYou should see a progress bar and the result of the test.\nBecause the container image is marked as an executable, we can also run it directly without having to specify the apptainer command (although it will still run using Apptainer):\n./speedtest-py3.10.sif\nTry it with some different values of M and N:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nNow try specifying a different output file:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif -- -m 30_000 -n 1000 --output py3.10.txt\ncat py3.10.txt # Show the results\nHow do we build the image for Python 3.11? We could copy the definition file and change PY_VERSION to 3.11, but that would be a lot of work. Instead, we can use the --build-arg option of the apptainer build command to pass the value of PY_VERSION as a build argument to the definition file:\napptainer build --build-arg PY_VERSION=3.11 speedtest-py3.11.sif speedtest.def\nNow we can run the script using the new image:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nWe can still use the environment variables M and N to set the values of m and n:\nexport M=30_000 N=1000\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif\nThis makes it easier to run both containers with the same values of M and N without having to specify them each time.\nIf we wanted to, we could even use OUTPUT_FILE to specify the output file instead of using the --output option because we let click know that OUTPUT_FILE is an alternative for the --output argument if there is no --output option:\nexport OUTPUT_FILE=py3.11-2.txt\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif\nunset OUTPUT_FILE # Unset the OUTPUT_FILE environment variable so that it doesn't affect the next command\nBecause we specified the %runscript section in the definition file, we can also execute the script directly without having to specify the apptainer command:\n./speedtest-py3.11.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nLet’s recreate the comparison we did earlier:\nexport M=1000 N=100_000\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif --output py3.10.txt\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif --output py3.11.txt\n1cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt | apptainer exec speedtest-py3.10.sif python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'\n\n1\n\nWe’re using apptainer exec instead of apptainer run because we want to run the python3 command instead of the command specified in the definition file.\n\n\nHere’s a demo of the above commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApptainer caches all the images it downloads in a cache directory to avoid downloading them again. The cache can get quite large, so it’s a good idea to clear it from time to time.\nYou can see the size of the cache directory by running:\napptainer cache list\nTo clear the cache, run:\napptainer cache clean\nThat should free up some space.\n\n\n\nBy default, Apptainer stores the cache in ~/.apptainer/cache. This can be a problem if you have a small home directory (e.g., if you are using the default 10 GB quota on Klone). You can change the cache directory by setting the APPTAINER_CACHE environment variable. For example, to set the cache directory to /tmp/&lt;your-username&gt;/apptainer-cache, you can use the $USER environment variable:\nexport APPTAINER_CACHE=\"/tmp/$USER/apptainer-cache\"\nApptainer will create the cache directory if it does not already exist.\nYou’ll need to set the APPTAINER_CACHE environment variable every time you want to use Apptainer, so it’s a good idea to add it to your ~/.bashrc file so that it is always set when you log in.",

    "text": "Let’s try running a Python script using Apptainer. The release notes for Python version 3.11 say that it is “between 10-60% faster than Python 3.10”. Is this true? Let’s find out! We’ll write a simple Python script to test this and use Apptainer to run it on Python 3.10 and Python 3.11.\n\n\nspeedtest.py\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os, sys, timeit\n\n# Get the values of the environment variables M and N, or use default values:\n1n = int(os.getenv(\"N\", default=1000))  # How many numbers to join\nm = int(os.getenv(\"M\", default=100))  # How many times to run the test\n\n# Function to test:\ndef join_nums():\n    return \"-\".join([str(i) for i in range(n)])\n\n2# Print details about the test to stderr:\nprint(\n    f\"Running join_nums() {n}*{m} times on Python v{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\",\n    file=sys.stderr,\n)\n\n# Run the test:\n3result = timeit.timeit(join_nums, number=m)\n\n# Print the result:\n4print(result)\n\n\n1\n\nThe os.getenv function retrieves the value of an environment variable or returns a default value if the variable is not set.\n\n2\n\nHere, we use the file parameter to print(), which makes it write to the standard error stream (stderr) instead of the default standard output stream (stdout). This is useful because we want to print the result of the test to stdout so that we can save the output by redirecting it to a file, but we also want to print some information about the test to stderr so that it doesn’t get mixed up with the result.\n\n3\n\ntimeit.timeit() runs a function multiple times and returns the average time it took to run the function.\n\n4\n\nThe print function prints to the standard output stream (stdout) by default. We can redirect this to a file in bash using the &gt; operator.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to paste and save a file in the terminal\n\n\n\nYou can use the nano command to create a new file and paste the contents of the file into the terminal. To do this, run nano &lt;filename&gt; in the terminal, paste the contents of the file into the terminal, and press Ctrl+X to exit. You will be asked if you want to save the file. Press Y to save the file and Enter to confirm the filename.\n\n\nNow let’s run the script using Python 3.10 and Python 3.11. For the image, we will use the python:3.10-slim and python:3.11-slim images from the official Python images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTagged container releases\n\n\n\nThe python:3.10-slim and python:3.11-slim images are tagged with the version of Python they contain. This means that if you pull the python:3.10-slim image today, it will always contain Python 3.10, even if Python 3.11 is released tomorrow.\nThe python:*-slim images are designed to contain only the minimal set of packages required to run Python and are much smaller than the standard Python images (~45 MiB vs ~350 MiB).\n\n\nWe’ll use the apptainer exec command to run the script inside an Apptainer container:\n1apptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py\n\n1\n\nThe apptainer exec command runs a command inside an Apptainer container. The docker://python:3.10-slim argument tells Apptainer to use the python:3.10-slim image from the Docker registry. The python3 ./speedtest.py argument tells Apptainer to run the python3 command inside the container and provide it with the argument speedtest.py.\n\n\nYou should see something like:\n1Running join_nums() 1000*100 times on Python v3.10\n20.003154174002702348\n\n1\n\nThis is printed to stderr because we used print(..., file=sys.stderr) in the script.\n\n2\n\nThis is printed to stdout.\n\n\nIt probably didn’t take very long to run the script. Let’s try running it again with larger values of M and N. We can set the values of M and N by setting them as environment variables in the bash command prompt before running the script:\n1export M=1000 N=100_000\napptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py\n\n1\n\nThe export command sets the values of the M and N environment variables and makes them available to other programs like apptainer. We’re setting N to 100_000 instead of 100000 because underscores can be used in Python to make large numbers easier to read. This is a feature of Python, not the shell (which interprets 100_000 as just a string and not a number).\n\n\nIt should take a bit longer to run this time.\nNow, let’s try running the script using Python 3.11:\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest.py\nWe don’t need to set the values of M and N again because they are still set from the previous command via export (unless you closed your terminal window or logged out).\nIt probably took a bit less time to run the script this time.\nIs Python 3.11 really faster than Python 3.10? Let’s find out by redirecting the output of the script to a file:\n1apptainer exec docker://python:3.10-slim python3 speedtest.py &gt; py3.10.txt\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest.py &gt; py3.11.txt\n2cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt # show the results\n\n1\n\nIn bash, the &gt; operator redirects the output of a command to a file. If the file already exists, it will be overwritten. If you want to append to an existing file instead, use the &gt;&gt; operator. These operators can be used with any command, not just apptainer. For example, ls &gt; my_files.txt will write the output of ls to the file my_files.txt.\n\n2\n\nThe cat command prints the contents of a file to&gt; stdout. If you want to print the contents of multiple files, you can list them all as arguments to cat.\n\n\nWe see the results, but they’re not very easy to interpret. Let’s pipe the output to Python to calculate the speedup:\n1cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt | apptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'\n\n1\n\nThe | operator pipes the output of one command to the input of another. In this case, we are piping the output of cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt to the input of apptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'. The -c option of the python3 command tells Python to run the code provided as an argument. The code print(float(input())/float(input())) reads two lines of input from standard input, converts them to floating point numbers, divides the first by the second, and prints the result.\n\n\nIn my case, Python 3.11 was about 1.3 times faster than Python 3.10. Not bad!\nHere’s a demo of the above commands. Note that I used M=200 and N=50_000 instead of M=1000 and N=100_000 because it takes a long time to run the script with the larger values of M and N.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat if we wanted to add a command-line interface to make it possible to run the script with different values of M and N without having to set them as environment variables? A user might want to set the values of M and N as command-line arguments. Maybe they would also like to be able to specify the output file instead of redirecting the output to a file. And how about a progress bar? Users love progress bars!\nThis sounds like a tall order, but it’s quite easy to do in Python using the click package for Python. Here’s the new script:\n\n\nspeedtest-cli.py\n\n#!/usr/bin/env python3\nimport os, sys, timeit\nimport click\n\n\n# Set up the context for the command line interface and add the options:\n@click.command()\n@click.option(\n    \"-n\",  # The name of the option\n    envvar=\"N\",  # Use the environment variable `N` if it exists\n    default=1000,  # Default value if `N` is not set\n    help=\"How many numbers to join\",  # Help text for the `-n` option\n    type=int,  # Convert the value to an integer\n)\n@click.option(\n    \"-m\",\n    envvar=\"M\",\n    default=100,\n    help=\"How many times to run the test\",\n    type=int,\n)\n@click.option(\n    \"--output\",\n1    default=\"/dev/stdout\",  # Write the result to stdout by default\n    help=\"Path to the output file\",\n2    type=click.Path(writable=True, dir_okay=False),\n)\n3def speedtest(m, n, output):\n    \"\"\"Run a speed test.\"\"\"  # Help text for the command\n\n    def join_nums():  # The function to test\n        return \"-\".join([str(i) for i in range(n)])\n\n    print(f\"Running join_nums() {n}*{m} times on Python v{sys.version_info.major}.{sys.version_info.minor}\", file=sys.stderr)\n    bar = click.progressbar(  # Create a progress bar\n        length=n * m,\n        update_min_steps=n,  # Update the progress bar every `n` steps\n        file=sys.stderr,  # Print the progress bar to stderr\n    )\n\n    def join_nums_progress():  # Wrap the function to add the progress bar\n        result = join_nums()\n        bar.update(n)  # Increment the progress bar by `n` steps\n        return result\n\n    result = timeit.timeit(join_nums_progress, number=m)  # Run the test\n\n    bar.render_finish()  # Stop rendering the progress bar\n\n    with open(output, \"w\") as f:  # Open the output file for writing\n        print(result, file=f)  # Write the result to the output file\n\n    if output != \"/dev/stdout\":  # Show the output path if it's not stdout\n        print(f\"Result written to {output}\", file=sys.stderr)\n\n\n4if __name__ == \"__main__\":  # Run the script if it's executed directly\n    speedtest()\n\n\n1\n\nWe set the default value of --output to /dev/stdout so that the script will print the result to stdout by default.\n\n2\n\nclick provides a Path type that can be used to validate paths. The writable=True option tells click that the path must be writable. The dir_okay=False option tells click that the path must not be a directory.\n\n3\n\nThe @click.command() decorator tells click that the first function definition that follows defines a command. The @click.option() decorators add options to the command-line interface. click passes the values of these options to the function using the names of the options (lowercased and with - replaced by _).\n\n4\n\nThe __name__ == \"__main__\" check ensures that the script is only run if it is executed directly and not if it is imported as a module. This is useful if you want to use the script as a module in another script. We don’t need to do this here, but it’s a good habit to get into.\n\n\nNow, let’s try running the script with apptainer exec:\napptainer exec docker://python:3.11-slim python3 speedtest-cli.py\nYou probably got a ModuleNotFoundError because the click package is not installed in the python:3.11-slim image. If you know some Python, you might think, “I could probably fix this if I install the click module via pip.” And you would be right – if you were running the script in the version of Python that’s normally installed on your computer. But we’re running the script inside an Apptainer container, so we need to install the click module inside the container. Furthermore, we’re using two different versions of Python, so we need to install the click module in the containers for both versions.\nWe’ll solve this by writing an Apptainer definition file to build a custom Apptainer image that contains the click module. Here’s the definition file:\n\n\nspeedtest.def\n\n1Bootstrap: docker # Where to get the base image from.\n2From: python:{{ PY_VERSION }}-slim # Which container to use as a base image.\n\n3%arguments\n    # The version of Python to use:\n    PY_VERSION=3.10\n  \n%files\n4    speedtest-cli.py /opt/local/bin/speedtest # Copy the script to the container.\n\n5%post\n    # Create a virtual environment in /opt/venv to install our dependencies:\n6    /usr/local/bin/python -m venv /opt/venv\n\n    # Install `click` and don't cache the downloaded files:\n7    /opt/venv/bin/pip install --no-cache-dir click\n\n    # Print a message to stderr to let the user know that the installation is done:\n8    echo \"$(/opt/venv/bin/python3 --version): Done installing dependencies.\" &gt;&2\n\n    # Make the `speedtest` command executable:\n9    chmod +x /opt/local/bin/speedtest\n\n10%environment\n11    export PATH=\"/opt/local/bin:$PATH\" # Add the directory with the `speedtest` command to the PATH.\n12    export PATH=\"/opt/venv/bin:$PATH\" # Add the virtual environment to the PATH.\n\n13%runscript\n    # Run the Python script with the arguments passed to the container:\n14    speedtest \"$@\"\n\n15%test\n    # Run the speedtest command to check if it works:\n    speedtest -m 2000 -n 1000\n\n\n1\n\nEach definition file must start with a Bootstrap line that tells Apptainer where to get the base image from. In this case, we’re using the docker bootstrap, which means that we’re getting the base image from the Docker registry.\n\n2\n\nWe’re using the python:{{ PY_VERSION }} image as the base image. The { PY_VERSION } part refers to a template variable and will be replaced with the value of the PY_VERSION build argument when we build the image. This means we can use the same definition file to build images for different versions of Python.\n\n3\n\nThe definition file is split into sections. The %arguments section defines the build arguments for the image. We’re using the PY_VERSION argument to specify the version of Python to use, and we’re setting the default value to 3.10.\n\n4\n\nThe %files section defines the files to copy inside the container. We’re copying the speedtest-cli.py script to /opt/local/bin/speedtest in the container. /opt/local/bin is a good place to put scripts that you want to be able to run from anywhere in the container, but you should add the directory to the PATH environment variable if you want to be able to run the script without specifying the full path to the script. We’re removing the .py extension from the script name because we want to be able to run the script by typing speedtest instead of speedtest-cli.py.\n\n5\n\nThe %post section defines the commands to run inside the container after the base image has been downloaded. This is where you should install any dependencies that your script needs.\n\n6\n\nWe’re using the python -m venv command to create a virtual environment in /opt/venv, which is where we will install the click module.\n\n7\n\nWe run pip from the virtual environment to install the click module. We use the --no-cache-dir option to tell pip not to cache the downloaded files. This is useful because we don’t need the downloaded files after we’ve installed the click module – otherwise, they would just take up space in the built image.\n\n8\n\nWe’re using the echo command to print a message to stderr to let the user know that the installation is done. We’re using the &gt;&2 operator to redirect the output of echo to stderr instead of stdout. The $(...) syntax runs the commands within and inserts the output into a string. In this case, we’re using it to insert the output of python3 --version into the string we’re about to print with echo. This helps the user know which version of Python the built image will contain.\n\n9\n\nWe’re using the chmod command to make the speedtest command executable – otherwise, we wouldn’t be able to run it without passing it to the python3 command.\n\n10\n\nThe %environment section defines the environment variables to set in the container. Note that the environment variables set in the %environment section are only set when the container is run. They are not set when the image is built, so they are not available in the %post section, even if you move the %environment section above the %post section.\n\n11\n\nWe’re prepending /opt/local/bin to the existing value of the PATH environment variable so that we can run the speedtest command from anywhere in the container. The PATH environment variable is used by the shell to find commands. If you want to be able to run a command without specifying the full path to the command, you need to add the directory containing the command to the PATH environment variable, separated by a colon (:).\n\n12\n\nAdding the /opt/venv/bin directory to the PATH environment variable makes it possible to run the python command from the virtual environment we created in the %post section. This is necessary because we installed the click module in the virtual environment, so we need to run the python command from the virtual environment to be able to import the click module.\n\n13\n\nThe %runscript section defines the command to run when the container is run. In this case, we’re running the speedtest command we installed in the %post section.\n\n14\n\nWe’re using the $@ special parameter to pass all the arguments passed to the container to the speedtest command – for example, if you run apptainer exec speedtest.sif --output output.txt, the speedtest command will be run with the arguments --output output.txt.\n\n15\n\nThe %test section defines the command to run when the image is built. In this case, we’re running the speedtest command to make sure that it works.\n\n\nNow we can build the image using the apptainer build command. The first argument is the name of the image to build. The second argument is the path to the definition file:\napptainer build speedtest-py3.10.sif speedtest.def\nIt might take a little while to build the image. If everything goes according to plan, you should see the output of a test run at the end of the build process when the %test section is run.\nWhen it’s done, the image will be saved as speedtest-py3.10.sif in the current directory. This image encapsulates the script and all its dependencies, so we can run it on any system that has Apptainer installed without having to worry about whether the system has a specific version of Python or the click module installed. Furthermore, because we defined a %runscript section in the definition file, we can run the script without having to specify the python3 command.\nTo run the containerized script, we can run the apptainer run command, which is similar to apptainer exec but launches the commands in the %runscript section of the definition file instead of the command specified as an argument:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif\nYou should see a progress bar and the result of the test.\nBecause the container image is marked as an executable, we can also run it directly without having to specify the apptainer command (although it will still run using Apptainer):\n./speedtest-py3.10.sif\nTry it with some different values of M and N:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nNow try specifying a different output file:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif -- -m 30_000 -n 1000 --output py3.10.txt\ncat py3.10.txt # Show the results\nHow do we build the image for Python 3.11? We could copy the definition file and change PY_VERSION to 3.11, but that would be a lot of work. Instead, we can use the --build-arg option of the apptainer build command to pass the value of PY_VERSION as a build argument to the definition file:\napptainer build --build-arg PY_VERSION=3.11 speedtest-py3.11.sif speedtest.def\nNow we can run the script using the new image:\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nWe can still use the environment variables M and N to set the values of m and n:\nexport M=30_000 N=1000\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif\nThis makes it easier to run both containers with the same values of M and N without having to specify them each time.\nIf we wanted to, we could even use OUTPUT_FILE to specify the output file instead of using the --output option because we let click know that OUTPUT_FILE is an alternative for the --output argument if there is no --output option:\nexport OUTPUT_FILE=py3.11-2.txt\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif\nunset OUTPUT_FILE # Unset the OUTPUT_FILE environment variable so that it doesn't affect the next command\nBecause we specified the %runscript section in the definition file, we can also execute the script directly without having to specify the apptainer command:\n./speedtest-py3.11.sif -m 30_000 -n 1000\nLet’s recreate the comparison we did earlier:\nexport M=1000 N=100_000\napptainer run speedtest-py3.10.sif --output py3.10.txt\napptainer run speedtest-py3.11.sif --output py3.11.txt\n1cat py3.10.txt py3.11.txt | apptainer exec speedtest-py3.10.sif python3 -c 'print(float(input())/float(input()))'\n\n1\n\nWe’re using apptainer exec instead of apptainer run because we want to run the python3 command instead of the command specified in the definition file.\n\n\nHere’s a demo of the above commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApptainer caches all the images it downloads in a cache directory to avoid downloading them again. The cache can get quite large, so it’s a good idea to clear it from time to time.\nYou can see the size of the cache directory by running:\napptainer cache list\nTo clear the cache, run:\napptainer cache clean\nThat should free up some space.\n\n\n\nBy default, Apptainer stores the cache in ~/.apptainer/cache. This can be a problem if you have a small home directory (e.g., if you are using the default 10 GB quota on Klone). You can change the cache directory by setting the APPTAINER_CACHE environment variable. For example, to set the cache directory to /tmp/&lt;your-username&gt;/apptainer-cache, you can use the $USER environment variable:\nexport APPTAINER_CACHE=\"/tmp/$USER/apptainer-cache\"\nApptainer will create the cache directory if it does not already exist.\nYou’ll need to set the APPTAINER_CACHE environment variable every time you want to use Apptainer, so it’s a good idea to add it to your ~/.bashrc file so that it is always set when you log in.",
