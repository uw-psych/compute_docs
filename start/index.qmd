# Getting Started

1.  Get access to Hyak:
    -   Active UW students can join UW Reserach Computing Club (RCC) to gain access to STF-funded nodes.
    -   PI's or labs should purchase dedicated storage and compute resources.
2.  [Login to a cluster via SSH](./connect-ssh.qmd):

::: panel-tabset
## Klone

``` bash
ssh UWNetID@klone.hyak.uw.edu
```

## Mox

``` bash
ssh UWNetID@mox.hyak.uw.edu
```
:::

3.  Navigate and understand its [compute infrastructure](../compute/index.qmd):
    -   Request compute jobs with [Slurm](../compute/slurm.qmd)
    -   Access certain programs with [Lmod software modules](../compute/lmod.qmd)
    -   Build and run software containers with [Apptainer](../compute/apptainer.qmd)
    -   Create and access a virtual desktop with [hyakvnc](../start/hyakvnc.qmd)
